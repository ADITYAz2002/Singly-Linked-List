# Linked-List

Lined lists are the linear or sequential data structure where elements are sorted at non-conteguous memory locations linked
to each other using pointers.

They do not allow any random access of variables and thus do not have *Binary Search*
Extra Memory is required for pointers of each node 
It is not Cache Friendly
